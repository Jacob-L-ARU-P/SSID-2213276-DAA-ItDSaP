This is because the points start landing on top of each other, making it hard to tell if there are many points in an area or just a few. To solve this, some charts 'bin' the data first, in much the same way a histogram does. Unlike a histogram, a bin plot shows density using shading with colours representing higher densities.\n","\n","Seaborn can create a bin plot using its `jointplot` function, which also provides histograms of the two variables.\n","\n","> Run the code below to create a hexagonal bin plot of life expectancy against GDP"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-12T12:58:36.610084Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-12T12:58:36.609875Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-12T12:58:37.18278Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-12T12:58:37.181755Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-12T12:58:36.610059Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.604122,"end_time":"2022-02-14T16:39:35.63465","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-02-14T16:39:35.030528","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# create a hexagonal bin plot\n","sns.jointplot(data=countries_data, kind='hex', x='GDP per capita (US$)', y='Life expectancy at birth 2010');"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.032502,"end_time":"2022-02-14T16:39:35.700293","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-02-14T16:39:35.667791","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["> Add code below to create a hexagonal bin plot of life expectancy against physician density."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-12T12:58:37.184175Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-12T12:58:37.183947Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-12T12:58:37.187813Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-12T12:58:37.187235Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-12T12:58:37.184148Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.038896,"end_time":"2022-02-14T16:39:35.771935","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-02-14T16:39:35.733039","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# create a hexagonal bin plot"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.032241,"end_time":"2022-02-14T16:39:35.836497","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-02-14T16:39:35.804256","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## Exploring the association between other variables and life expectancy\n","> * Add code below to explore the association betweeen other variables and life expectancy, using `hue` or `size` to add a third variable as appropriate.\n","> * You can create additional code boxes using the **+ Code** button."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-12T12:58:37.189121Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-12T12:58:37.188807Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-12T12:58:37.200918Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-12T12:58:37.200108Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-12T12:58:37.189095Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.038677,"end_time":"2022-02-14T16:39:35.907762","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-02-14T16:39:35.869085","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# create a scatter plot"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.032819,"end_time":"2022-02-14T16:39:35.972779","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-02-14T16:39:35.93996","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Communicating the result\n","## Checkpoint 5\n","\n","> Use your analysis to answer the problem: ***Which features of countries are associated with longer life expectancy?***"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
